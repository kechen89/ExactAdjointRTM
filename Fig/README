================================================================================

	This directory contains the makefile necessary
	to reproduce all the figures in the GEOPHYSICS paper:

	An exact adjoint operation pair in time extrapolation and
	its application in least-squares reverse-time migration

	by Jun Ji. DOI: 10.1190/1.3173894.

================================================================================
	
  1) Prerequisites 
	You need to have SEPLIB (seplib-6.3.12) installed in your system.

  2) Reproduce all figures 
      	To reproduce all figures presented in the paper, run "make"

        # make

  3) Display figures
	To display all figures in the directory, use "tube" SEPLIB command as follows:

	# tube *.v

  4) Clean-up 
	To clean up the directory by removing all the intermediate file 
        generated while making figures.

	# make clean

================================================================================

	This directory contains all programs, which are used to generate 
	all figures appeared in the paper, and compiling rules.

================================================================================

  2) Fix the local directory structure of SEPLIB in makefile

	Currently the SEPLIB directories are defined as follows 

		SEPLIBDIR = /usr/local/SEP/lib
		SEPBINDIR = /usr/local/SEP/bin
		SEPINCDIR = /usr/local/SEP/include

	You need to change is as your system has it.

  3) run make
	To compile all programs required to make all figures in the paper.

        # make

  4) Dot-product test 

	To run dot-product test for the 1D Reverse-time Migration program

	# make dot1d

	To run dot-product test for the 2D Reverse-time Migration program

	# make dot2d

  5) Clean-up the directory 

	To clean up the directory by removing all the intermediate file 
        generated during compilation.

	# make clean
