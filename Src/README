	This directory contains the program source code necessary to
	reproduce all the results in the GEOPHYSICS paper:

        An exact adjoint operation pair in time extrapolation and
        its application in least-squares reverse-time migration

        by Jun Ji. DOI: 10.1190/1.3173894.

================================================================================

  1) Prerequisites 

	You need to have Intel Fortran Compiler for Linux "ifort" and 
        SEPLIB (seplib-6.3.12) installed on your system.

  2) Fix the local directory structure of SEPLIB in makefile

	Currently the SEPLIB directories are defined as follows 

		SEPLIBDIR = /usr/local/SEP/lib
		SEPBINDIR = /usr/local/SEP/bin
		SEPINCDIR = /usr/local/SEP/include

	If your system is different, you will need to change these.

  3) run make
	To compile all programs required to make all figures in the paper.

        # make

  4) Dot-product test 

	To run dot-product test for the 1D Reverse-time Migration program

	# make dot1d

	To run dot-product test for the 2D Reverse-time Migration program

	# make dot2d

  5) Clean-up the directory 

	To clean up the directory by removing all the intermediate files
        generated during compilation.

	# make clean
