	This directory contains all the programs, compiling rules,
	and scripts necessary to reproduce all the figures appearing
	in the GEOPHYSICS paper:

        An exact adjoint operation pair in time extrapolation and
        its application in least-squares reverse-time migration

  1) Prerequisites 

	For program compilation, you need to have 
	Intel Fortran Compiler for Linux "ifort",
        SEPLIB (6.3.12) and Madagascar (0.9.6) installed on your system.

  2) Recompilation

	To recompile all programs, go to "./Src" directory and run "make"
	As prerequisites, you need to have 
	Intel Fortran Compiler for Linux "ifort" and 
        the SEPLIB (seplib-6.3.12) installed in your system.

	# cd Src
	# make

  3) Reproduce all figures 
	
      	To reproduce all figures presented in the paper,
	go to "./Fig" directory and run "make"

	# cd ./Fig
        # make
        # tube *.v

  4) Clean-up whole directory

	# make clean
